# dataresources
Data available online 

The purpose of this repository is merely to point out to people some data available online that anyone can access and start their own data science projects.
These resources were taken in [this repository](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/03_GettingData/04_05_dataResources/index.Rmd) from Jeef Leek, during a class in the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning) course, available on Coursera
